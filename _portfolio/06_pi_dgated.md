title: "Improved Sensitivity of Myocardial ASL using Parallel Imaging and Double-Gating"
date: 2016-05-30
excerpt: "[**Figure:**](https://hdocmsu.github.io/images/projects/pi_dgated.png) The project aims to (1) improve sensitivity of myocardial arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging using parallel imaging and double-gating and (2) to improve robustness to heart rate variation of myocardial ASL perfusion imaging with the use of double-gating.
