I'm a clinical scientist (Magnetic Resonance Imaging physicist) at Canon Medical Systems USA where I work to translate innovative imaging solutions (Deep Learning Reconstruction, Compressed Sensing, Ultra-short Echo Time imaging, Arterial Spin Labeling, etc.) to the clinical environment by designing and conducting hypothesis-driven and clinical-evaluation research studies and engaging in the FDA 510k application processes from planning to FDA Pre-Submission (Q-Sub) meeting to preparing and reviewing application materials to responding to FDA reviewers' questions. I have a track record of collaboration with radiologists, cardiologists, scientists, engineers, application specialists, MRI technicians, product managers, marketers, legal counselors, and regulatory affairs specialists.

I enjoy learning new knowledge, generating new ideas, experimenting with new tools, and solving impactful problems in principal ways. My expertise and interests include:

* Design and execute scientifically sound and FDA 510k-cleared hypothesis-driven and clinical-evaluation research studies
* End-to-end project managements and inter-disciplinary collaborations
* Fundamental and translational MRI research related to quantitative imaging, novel pulse sequence design, and image reconstruction
* Applied data science, statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning to medical imaging and healthcare
* Data visualization, data analysis, and statistics using Python, R, and Matlab
* Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming for quantitative imaging with uncertainty quantification
* Mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and optimization
* Automatic and reproducible pipelines for data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, and report/presentation generation using Bash, Python, R, and related packages

Outside work, I enjoy spending time with family in nature and updating the latest advances in science and technology.
